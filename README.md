# Connect4 Multiplayer Website
 
This is a connect4 multiplayer game I made as a final project for my Web Development class. This was a solo dolo project which I made using a TON of javascript, some HTML, pug, express, Node.js and a few other minor libraries. 

This is playable at this link here: https://safe-everglades-71495.herokuapp.com/ (give it a few seconds to load at first).

The game comes complete with a fully working user system where you can:
- add and delete friends
- you can change your profile privacy
- you can view other peoples profiles
- you can search for users 
- and much more! 

As for the game side:
- fully working multiplayer connect4 
- you can create public, private and friends only games
- you can view other games and chat at the same time
